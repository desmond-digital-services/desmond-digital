## Part 7: Competitive Positioning

### 7.1 Key Differentiators

| Factor | Desmond Digital | Competitors |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Autonomy Model | Headless by default | Human-in-loop required |
| Origin | Real operations experience | VC-funded theory |
| Architecture | Custom framework | API wrappers |
| Persistence | Multi-day, session-spanning | Session-scoped |
| Industry Fit | 24/7 operations specialty | General purpose |
| Pricing | Transparent tiers | Opaque/enterprise only |

### 7.2 Messaging Framework

**Tagline:** "Autonomy That Works When You Can't"

**Elevator Pitch:** 
"Most 'AI agents' are just chat interfaces that keep you as the bottleneck. FF-Terminal was built for the real world—where systems need to run unattended, where networks fail, and where humans sleep. We built it on a farm because that's where the need was real. Now it runs in factories, data centers, and operations that can't afford to pause."

**Key Messages:**
1. "Headless by architecture, not by accident"
2. "Built where it mattered, built to matter everywhere"
3. "We don't do wrappers. We build foundations."

---

## Part 8: Immediate Action Items

### Top 5 Priorities (Execute Now)

1. **Create Pricing Document** - Define what we sell and at what price
2. **Create Service Offerings** - Define the menu of services
3. **Create Pitch Deck** - Visual sales presentation
4. **Create Industry Demo** - Proof of industry applicability
5. **Create Blog Content** - Foundation for content marketing
