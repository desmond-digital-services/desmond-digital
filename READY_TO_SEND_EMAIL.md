## The Email

**Subject:** Built an autonomous agent framework that doesn't need you in the loop

---

Hi [Name],

I built FF-Terminal because every "agent tool" I tried kept requiring my attention. Chat interfaces, CLI wrappers, Claude Code clones—they all kept *me* as the bottleneck.

FF-Terminal is different. Headless by design. Agents that run unattended for hours. Multi-day context persistence. Custom architecture built for actual autonomy, not conversational AI with extra steps.

I built it on my farm because nothing else worked for real operations. Now it runs in other domains too.

**Quick test:** Give it a multi-step task and walk away. See if it finishes without you.

Happy to show you: https://github.com/0-CYBERDYNE-SYSTEMS-0/desmond-digital

## Personalized Version - John Deere Example

**Subject:** Farm-autonomous agents that run without prompts

Hi [Name],

Running a farm myself, I know how critical it is for systems to work without constant oversight. FF-Terminal started on my farm because nothing else could handle the reality of 24/7 agricultural operations—no chat interface, no prompts required, just autonomous operation.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to see how it handles irrigation, livestock monitoring, or supply chain coordination without human intervention?
