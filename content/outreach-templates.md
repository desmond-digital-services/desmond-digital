## Cold Outreach (Technical Buyers)

**Subject:** Built an autonomous agent framework that doesn't need you in the loop

Hi [Name],

I built FF-Terminal because every "agent tool" I tried kept requiring my attention. Chat interfaces, CLI wrappers, Claude Code clones—they all kept *me* as the bottleneck.

FF-Terminal is different. Headless by design. Agents that run unattended for hours. Multi-day context persistence. Custom architecture built for actual autonomy, not conversational AI with extra steps.

I built it on my farm because nothing else worked for real operations. Now it runs in other domains too.

Quick test: give it a multi-step task and walk away. See if it finishes without you.

No pitch deck. No VC funding. Just something that works.

Happy to show you: https://github.com/0-CYBERDYNE-SYSTEMS-0/desmond-digital

## LinkedIn Post

Three years ago, I was running a farm at 3 AM, watching crops need attention I couldn't give.

I tried every "AI agent" tool on the market.

Every single one required *me* to be there. Typing prompts. Confirming actions. Babysitting the process.

That's not automation. That's a different kind of captivity.

So I built something without that assumption.

FF-Terminal. Headless by design. Agents that run unattended. Multi-day context. Actual autonomy—not a chat interface with extra steps.

The farm still runs on it. So do other things now.

Most "agent tools" are wrappers. We built the framework underneath.

The AI industry is drowning in chatbots. This is about what comes after.

## Warm Intro

Hey [Mutual Contact],

Quick favor—I want to connect you with TD at Desmond Digital. He built an autonomous agent framework (FF-Terminal) that solves a problem I've seen you deal with: systems that actually run without constant human oversight.

He came at it from agriculture (runs a farm), but the architecture is industry-agnostic. Headless operation, persistent state, agents that reason across days—not just chat sessions.

Figured you two should talk. Happy to make intros.

## Notes on Usage

- **Cold outreach:** Works best for technical buyers who already tried Claude Code/Codex CLI and felt the bottleneck. Lead with the test—nothing sells like showing them it works unattended.

- **LinkedIn:** The 3 AM hook cuts through. Agriculture authenticity is the differentiator—every other AI founder built a tool; TD built one because he needed it.

- **Warm intro:** Let the mutual connection establish credibility first. You're not selling—you're introducing a solution to a problem they already have.
